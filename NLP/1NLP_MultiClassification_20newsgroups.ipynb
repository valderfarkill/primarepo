There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it?

The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF).

Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \\n\\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \\n\\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \\n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \\n\\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\\n\\nCome again?\\n\\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\\n>(34 lines deleted)\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S.

I don\\'t think it is the\\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\\n\\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\\n\\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\\n\\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\\n  between MSC and BC).\\n\\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\\n  references).\\n\\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\\nnot encountered them (yet).

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)?

What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope.

Can you give an example of a\\n>commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,\\n>or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer\\n>need to worry about unscrupulous \"healers\" taking advantage of\\n>people.\\n\\n\\nI would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of\\nthe squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting\\nany treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though \"accepted\", may\\nnot be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick\\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\\nsignificantly inflated by these \"quacks of a different color\".  In fact, I\\'d\\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\\non these \"quacks\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on \\'search-and-\\ndestroy-missions\\' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************\\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\\n***************************************************\\n\\nLately I\\'ve seen the word \"quack\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \"quack-quack\" and\\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\\n\\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  \"quack\" is a nebulous word\\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\\nscary.\\n\\nBut what do I know, I\\'ve already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\\nnewsgroup as being \\'anal retentive\\', and \\'psychotic\\'.  I look forward to more\\nnet.diagnoses.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\\n\\tof the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\\n\\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\\n\\n\",\n","  \"From: rosa@ghost.dsi.unimi.it (massimo rossi)\\nSubject: ide &scsi controller\\nOrganization: Computer Science Dep. - Milan University\\nLines: 16\\n\\nhi folks\\ni have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb\\nthe second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram)\\ni'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy\\na new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll \\nall of them\\nany companies?\\nhow many $?\\nand is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide\\nthe ram cache for 2 hd?

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\\nyou have a mixer!\\n\\nLots of luck!\\n-- \\n73, Tom\\n================================================================================\\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you\\'re a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn\\'t see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn\\'t tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action.

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n","  \"From: gomer+@pitt.edu (Richard J Coyle)\\nSubject: Re: How difficult is it to get Penguin tickets?\\nOrganization: University of Pittsburgh\\nLines: 14\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr18.201811.28965@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> dmoney@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Dean R Money) writes:\\n>The subject line says it all.

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\\nattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things\\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\\ndata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\\ndon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\\nthrusters and the like).\\n\\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\\nreboost.

But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.

(Delta Clipper\\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)

Andrew Byler)\\nSubject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY)\\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\\nLines: 152\\n\\nMichael Bushnell writes;\\n\\n>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western\\n>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that\\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\\n>it is not \"in use.\"\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\\nis the Spirit created.\"\\n\\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\\nit necessary to speak.

I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tJohn.\\n\",\n","  \"From: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Vesselin Bontchev)\\nSubject: Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption\\nReply-To: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de\\nOrganization: Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg\\nLines: 19\\n\\nmathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\\n\\n> bena@dec05.cs.monash.edu.au (Ben Aveling) writes:\\n> > Don't forget, you are in the country that wouldn't let the Russians\\n> > buy Apple II's because of security concerns.\\n\\n> That's nothing.

Metzger)\\nSubject: The Escrow Database.\\nOrganization: Partnership for an America Free Drug\\nLines: 77\\n\\nHere is a disturbing thought.\\n\\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n\\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n\\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\ndoubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n\\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\nevery person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n\\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\nisn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\nsecrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\nour companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n\\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\nfraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\nthe escrow databases.\\n\\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\\nClipper chips.\\n\\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\\ndoesn\\'t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\\nthat they realize that they can\\'t put things off forever, but they can\\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\\n\\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\\nit all.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n',\n","  'From: Kurt Godden <godden@gmr.com>\\nSubject: GM May Build Toyota-badged Car\\nOrganization: GM R&D\\nLines: 13\\nDistribution: world\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: ksg.cs.gmr.com\\nX-UserAgent: Nuntius v1.1.1d16\\nX-XXMessage-ID: <A7F46B03C301085E@ksg.cs.gmr.com>\\nX-XXDate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 13:54:11 GMT\\n\\nThis appeared today in the \\n\\nThe Japan Economic Journal reported GM plans to build a Toyota-badged car\\nin the US for sale in Japan.

But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n\\n-- \\nRoger Maynard \\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \\n',\n","  'From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\\nSubject: Re: Not the Omni!\\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\\nLines: 18\\n\\nCharley Wingate (mangoe@cs.umd.edu) wrote:\\n: \\n: >> Please enlighten me.

Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\\nended at about 6:30.\\n-- \\n\\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\\' Packet...\\n\\n',\n","  'From: wongda@eecg.toronto.edu (Daniel Y.H.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\\n                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\\n',\n","  'From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.

Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong.  We have\\n>all inherited this knowledge.  \\n\\nNo matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n","  \"From: ezzie@lucs2.lancs.ac.uk (One of those daze...)\\nSubject: Borland turbo C libraries for S3 graphics card\\nOrganization: Lancaster University Computer Society\\nLines: 5\\n\\nI've recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I'd like to do some\\nC programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me\\naccess the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C?\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\",\n","  'From: swh@capella.cup.hp.com (Steve Harrold)\\nSubject: Re: Need Info on Diamond Viper Video Card\\nOrganization: Hewlett Packard, Cupertino\\nLines: 46\\n\\nExperiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\\n\\nSeveral problems:\\n\\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\\n   of VRAM, which is what I have.

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n","  'From: lynch@hpcc01.corp.hp.com (Howard Lynch)\\nSubject: Re: PHILLIES SIGN MARK DAVIS\\nOrganization: the HP Corporate notes server\\nLines: 8\\n\\nI had heard the rumors about LA, Cin, Hou, and SD all being\\ninterested in Mark Davis, so it doesn\\'t surprise me that a\\nteam had to give up something and cash to actually get him.\\n\\nLynch \"MOB\"\\n\\nps.  anyone else draft this guy?  i really did and got a \\n     loud cry of \"when will you ever give up on this guy\" :-)\\n',\n","  \"From: tomacj@opco.enet.dec.com (THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO !!!)\\nSubject: MR2 - noisy engine.\\nOrganization: Digital Equipment Corporation\\nLines: 19\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: OPCO\\n\\n\\nG'day people,\\n\\t\\n\\tAre there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why\\nmy MR2's engine sounds noisy?

The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \\ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\\n>\\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\\n>I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\\nher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Who\\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\\n\\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \\nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\\n(or something like that).\\n\\nMay we all experience and accept God\\'s grace.\\n>\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nPaul Conditt\\t\\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\\nApplied Research\\tPhone:\\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\\n  Laboratories\\t\\tFedex:\\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\\nUniversity of Texas\\tPostal:\\t  P.O.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Our Lutheran parish just\\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \\na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\\nalways there.

I guess it\\'s easier to \"try\\n>something new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\\n\\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\\nbut listens very carefully to the committee\\'s suggestions.  It needs a strong\\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\\n \\nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\\nare not shared by everyone.\\n\\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don\\'t want \\nthem attending a show.  It\\'s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\\nis Not there.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn\\'t listen.  They are there to \\nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\\nministers.\\n\\nIn Christ,\\nKershner\\n-- \\nKershner Wyatt\\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com\\n\\nMy opinions are my own and aren\\'t necessarily my employer\\'s.\\n',\n","  'From: jlevine@rd.hydro.on.ca (Jody Levine)\\nSubject: Re: Wanted: Advice for New Cylist\\nOrganization: Ontario Hydro - Research Division\\nLines: 18\\n\\nIn article <C5r7Ey.7Mq@srgenprp.sr.hp.com> blaisec@sr.hp.com (Blaise Cirelli) writes:\\n>\\n>I\\'m thinking of buying a motorcycle.

Any scale.\\nThat\\'s what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that\\'s sincere, and may be\\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \\nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\\n \\n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\\n\\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \\nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\\n \\n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \\n>to be absolute truth.

Very few.

God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.\\n\\nRegards, \\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n","  \"From: npm@netcom.com (Nancy P.

Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.

You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins.

Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.\\n\\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \\nKenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. \\n\\n',\n","  'From: pla@sktb.demon.co.uk (\"Paul L.

The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\\ncall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider\\'s\\nequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\\nlisten without having to obtain a warrant.\\n\\nBut, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\\nto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\\nabove - they don\\'t *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\\nbut even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\\nwarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\\nit appears he wasn\\'t a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we\\'ll stop\\nlistening in\\'...\\n\\nYou have every reason to be scared shitless.

A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\\'s B.C.E. or\\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\\'ll\\ntry to get better.\\n\\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \\nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \\nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\\nhis set of excuses.  \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\'s is how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncoming truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \\n\\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \\n\\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex\\n\\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\\n by Francis Schaeffer.\\n',\n","  'From: wdstarr@athena.mit.edu (William December Starr)\\nSubject: Re: Debating special \"hate crimes\" laws\\nOrganization: Northeastern Law, Class of \\'93\\nLines: 61\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: nw12-326-1.mit.edu\\nIn-reply-to: thf2@midway.uchicago.edu\\n\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr4.235546.6450@midway.uchicago.edu>, \\nthf2@midway.uchicago.edu said:\\n\\n> > This sort [of] separate treatment by the law has no place in an\\n> > equal society; the solution to the fact that some classes are more\\n> > vulnerable to attack or discrimination is to do what has always\\n> > been done in response to imbalances in criminal activity and\\n> > citizen protection: to allocate _law enforcement_ resources to\\n> > more efficiently and effectively deal with the problems, not to\\n> > rewrite the _law_ itself.

Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\\n\\n\\n',\n","  'From: daz1@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (DEMOSTHENIS A.

This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged.

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n',\n","  \"From: mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider)\\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH!

I am as concerned about the media\\'s complicity in this\\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\\nshow the world how big her balls are.\\n\\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.

It\\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40\\'s, and\\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\\n\\n  Bamford\\'s book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government\\'s code-breakers?\\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson\\'s `gentlemen\\', but one\\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.\\'\\'\\n\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n\\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\\n\\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n  least heard of the ITAR.\\n\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n\\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\\n\\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn\\'t do much good if the cleartext\\n  is available this way.\\n\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\\n  corrections.)\\n\\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\\n\\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n\\n  The Beale Cypher Association\\n  P.O. Box 975\\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\\n\\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\\n  line:\\n\\n  send index\\n\\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n\\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\\n  string couldn\\'t appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n  string.\\n\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n\\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram\\'\\' includes\\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n\\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\\n\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n\\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\\n  ``should RSA be patented?\\'\\', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\\n\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\\n\\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\\n\\n  There\\'s all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\\n  course.

This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don\\'t think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\\'t come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n","  'From: hambidge@bms.com\\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH!

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I think Soar OEMs their stuff\\nfor a number of vendors.

The Preamble declares that the\\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by \\'the people of the\\n  the U.S.\\'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v.

Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\\ninterpretation.\\n\\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\\n\\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\\n\\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\\nmilitias mean?\"\\n\\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\\n\\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\\n\\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\\nthe other way around.\\n\\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\\n\\n    PS.

Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.

If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.

I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\nexample with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Data Considerations\\n\\n  The Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\n  Ohio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   *
